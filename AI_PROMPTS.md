# AI Prompt History

This document describes how AI tools were used during the development of this project.

## Usage of AI

AI (ChatGPT) was used as a development assistant to:

- Debug React state issues (wishlist count, cart quantity)
- Fix missing UI elements (cart +/- buttons, discount badge)
- Improve JSX structure and CSS layout
- Help with GitHub setup and project submission steps
- Assist in writing and structuring the README file

## Example Prompts

- "Fix wishlist count not updating in React"
- "Add cart increment and decrement buttons"
- "Why is discount badge not showing?"
- "Help structure a README for a React + Node project"
- "Prepare project for internship submission"

All final code decisions and implementation were reviewed and applied manually.
